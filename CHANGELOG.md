The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Rectifier: There was no difference in the result on the fourth filter. "Convert if possible/Do not convert if adjacent cond-line."
2. Text-Editor: The cursor jumped to the first line when the file was saved / the Save-button "stayed" in 'down'-position (actually, it was focused).
3. The 3D editor placed the tab of a newly opened part on the left of an already opened part, while in the text editor it was placed as expected on the right.

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Ctrl+Z with focus on 3D window shifted the focus to the text window.
2. A mouse click was sometimes ignored (while adding something in the 3D view)
3. Unificator: A vertex already snapped on a primitive vertex was able to move to another primitive.

-  ...use "Set x/y/z" to set the origin of subfiles and primitives to x/y/z
-  ...set the translation to the manipulator position (translate selection)
-  ...benefit from the fact that colour changes to the main colour are updated after leaving the options menu. 
-  ...benefit from the fact that the dialog for local rotation and scale transformations now initialises the pivot point with the manipulator position.

The following critical issues are fixed:

-  ...choose between world axis X/Y/Z and manipulator axis X/Y/Z for transformation tools (translate / rotate / scale selection / set selection X/Y/Z)

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. The colour value for colour 16 was not read from LDConfig.ldr
2. If you split a distance meter you got two normal edge lines instead of two distance meters.
3. LDPE did not complain about some duplicated lines (TYPE 2, 3, and 4).

### 31 Dec 2016
With the release of **0.8.27** you are able to...
- ...choose whether or not "Merge to Nearest Edge" splits the edge on merged vertices.
- ...limit unrectifier to only inline rect primitives (hold Ctrl and press the unrectifier button).
- ...adjust the direction of the manipulator to the direction of an edge. I changed the behavior of "Move Manipulator to the Nearest Edge"!

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Fixed an endless loop on the first start (affected 0.8.26 only).
2. Rectifier added the same edge line into two adjacent rectangle primitives.
3. Toggle comment / TEXMAP didn't adjust the text selection. 
4. The new render engine is now optional. Its automatic hardware detection was broken.
5. When you inserted a protractor, the order of the vertex triplet was not deterministic.
6. Unrectifier inserted an extraneous empty lines where rects were previously.
7. The quick fix of "invalid use of 'BFC INVERTNEXT' / Flat subfile" only removed the BFC INVERTNEXT statement. It should also invert the direction of the flat subfile in flat direction to keep the same BFC winding.


### 20 Nov 2016
With the release of **0.8.26** you are able to...
-  ...benefit from a brand new render engine (thanks to the power of OpenGL 3.3, which makes better use of the GPU).

-  ...benefit from a faster program start.
-  ...benefit from better performance for "Show All".

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Toggle comment / TEXMAP didn't adjust the text selection.
2. Sometimes a time-consuming selection with the selection rectangle did select nothing.
3. Background Image: "Previous" and "Next" buttons skipped images.
4. Edger2 wrongly added condlines in the middle of slightly warped quads
5. Edger2 put condlines/edge lines between surfaces and... protractors
6. Double click doesn't select the last character of a value if it was at end of line
7. !TEXMAP PLANAR: Wrong winding for CCW faces (with INVERTNEXT)
8. Fixed a rare exception regarding directory I/O


### 27 Sep 2016
With the release of **0.8.25** you are able to...
-  ...double click on a decimal number to select the whole value, including integer part, decimal part, decimal separator and minus sign if any (Text Editor).
- ...see that all three coordinates are unchecked when the coordinate dialog opens. The coordinates where you type in a value will become active (3D Editor, Merge/Split -> Set X/Y/Z).
- ...benefit a little from a faster draw method for lines and condlines.

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Flipper: Condlines were "not recalculated" so their control points were wrong after flipping.
2. The calculation for quad (and triangle) collinearity detection was wrong
3. Last added elements were not saved (3D Editor).
4. Wrong winding colour in some rare cases (CW: clockwise winding only)
5. Merge/Split -> Set X/Y/Z did not work sometimes
6. A ConcurrentModificationException occured in the process which hides condline control points
7. A ConcurrentModificationException occured during normal calculation for the LDraw Standard Mode

- ...use the metadata dialog (AKA "header dialog") on the text editor, too. 
- ...benefit from a faster program start.

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. It was not possible to activate "Create a new conditional line..." via a shortkey.
2. The new LDU to stud converter did not round correctly (20 LDU = 1 stud, rounded to one decimal place)
3. The Merge/split->Set X,Y,Z window appears only with a single vertex selection, it no longer works on a multiple selection (eg. to snap a selection on a plane).
4. The error message "Invalid use of 'BFC INVERTNEXT' / Flat subfile" got duplicated.


### 29 Aug 2016
With the release of **0.8.23** you are able to...
-  ...convert a unit to stud (20 LDU = 1.0 stud, rounded to one decimal place).
-  ...access all context menu features from somewhere else, too.
-  ...use the "Expand Area" buttons to "toggle" the divider position between the text and the 3d editor.
-  ...use more dynamic context menus.
-  ...benefit from the fact that there are bigger previews for the primitive area by default.
-  ...benefit from the fact that "Text on the right / 3D on the left" is now the default window setting. 
-  ...see the stud logos on the upper left view when you use the PartReview tool.
-  ...benefit from an asynchronous file header check (performance improvement / preparations for more validation features).

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Deleting all text lines from a file with the text editor could sometimes freeze LDPE.
2. The PartReview tool did not close+reload already opened "duplicated" files.
3. When PrimGen2 opened the file in the 3D editor, the corresponding file tab was not selected.
4. The menu key (from the keyboard) did not work on the file tree.
5. The menu key (from the keyboard) did not work on the 3D view.
6. Wrong singular / plural use for the word "duplicate".


### 19 Aug 2016
With the release of **0.8.22** you are able to...
- ...use a "new" tool: A PrimGen2 clone is now added to the list of tools.
- ...choose whether Intersector should hide things or not (default is not to hide).
- ...benefit from "realtime" asynchronous identical line detection. LDPE detects now duplicates during input with very low latency.
- ...benefit from a better "Save As..." implementation. It shows a warning if a file is going to be overwritten.
- ...set the thickness of the lines (type 2 or 5) to zero.
- ...to see your LDraw username / real name on the header dialog ("Add a comment or header entry...").
- ...benefit from the fact that the position of the divider between the text and the 3D editor gets restored on start.
- ...use buttons to quickly "fullscreen" either the text or 3D editor and a third icon which restores the divided view.
- ...use buttons to maximise / rearrange the area on the left side of the 3D view (selection, snapping, part tree, primitive area).
- ...set the second line for an angle protractor to a defined length.

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. "Toggle Comment" / "Toggle !TEXMAP" caused data corruption when it was toggled on the last line of a file.
2. The "Selection:" tab was broken (it was not possible to edit lines, distance meters and subfile references)
3. You were not able to open a file in the text editor sometimes (on separate window mode).
4. Wrong line width was used in "Special Condline Mode" / "Random Colour Mode".
5. When you opened a file in the 3D editor sometimes it was not added to the recent file list.


### 6 Aug 2016
With the release of **0.8.21** you are able to...
-  ...set the second line in a angle protractor to a defined angle (with the selection tab).
-  ...decide when "Move Adjacent Data" will be deactivated (new option).
-  ...orientate the manipulator relative to the vertex location.
-  ...set the vertex position to the position from a clipboard vertex.
-  ...set the vertex position to the manipulator position.
-  ...remove the target type from the selection (switch the object type while holding  Alt). 
-  ...deselect an object with the selection rectangle (while holding Ctrl+Alt). 
-  ...benefit from more digits on some important numerical fields.

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Issues regarding "Move Adjacent Data".
2. The red close cross on the tabs in the 3D editor did not close the correct tab sometimes.
3. It was not possible to measure an existing edge line / triangle because LDPE prevented the creation of a distance meter / protractor on top of an edge line / triangle.
4. Various usability bugs with "Open Part File" / "Save as..."
5. Drag&Drop a file to the text editor opened the file in the 3D window, too (when sync. tabs was off). 
6. Drag&Drop a file to the text editor created new superflous tabs when a revert was cancelled.
7. "New Part File" from the text editor opened the file in the 3D window, too (when sync. tabs was off). 
8. A change to the colour palette deleted the palette separator all editor windows. 
9. "Open Part File" from the text editor opened the file in the 3D window, too (when sync. tabs was off). 
10. "Save As..." from the text editor opened the file in the 3D window, too (when sync. tabs was off). 


### 30 Jul 2016
With the release of **0.8.20** you are able to...
- ...use the 3D editor and the text editor in one window. You can enable this under "Options...->Misc. Options->Text and 3D editor arrangement". It needs a restart of the application.
- ...use the TJunctionFinder to just "find" possible T-junctions without changing the mesh.
- ...deselect objects only with Ctrl+Click (Ctrl+Marquee is not possible anymore).
- ...add objects to the selection (Ctrl is pressed and you use the selection marquee or Ctrl+Click)
- ...benefit from the fact that the existing selection is cleared if nothing was selected and Ctrl was not pressed.
- ...find the "Last opened Files/Projects" on the "New Part - Open Part - ..." toolbar
- ...benefit from the fact that empty text editor windows are populated with a new tab instead of creating a new text editor window.
- ...restore the complete viewport state for different files. Each file has now its own 3D viewport configuration. Open file A, activate "Random Colours" and you switch to file B to do something different without "Random Colours". If you switch back to file A, "Random Colours" are activated again. However, this automatic feature is not limited to random colours. It includes every 3D viewport setting.
- ..."group" a selection. Select non-subfile content in the 3D editor. Open the context menu over the 3D view and select "Join selection (Text Editor)" to bring together what belongs together!
- ...see a warning/info, when "Move Adjacent Data" is on (for translate/rotate/scale).
- ...benefit from the fact that "Quick Fix Similar" for vertex declarations deletes other vertices (!LPE VERTEX), too. 

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. SyncEdit: The cursor jumped ahead after I tried to edit a vertex 
2. Switching the tabs in the 3D editor modified the last visited file location. 
3. Some issues with the hint/warning/error tree.
4. Pasting something does not disable "Move Adjacent Data".
5. The selection highlight feature in the text editor was sometimes not synchronised with the 3D view.


### 23 Jul 2016
With the release of **0.8.19** you are able to...
-  ...use tabs in the 3D editor along with the tree on the left side.
-  ...use a button to sync. the tab selection from tabs in the 3D editor with the text editor.
-  ...see a dialog when you try to re-load an unsaved file again.
-  ...smooth a set of vertices (with realtime preview)

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. [Recurring] "Conditional Control Point Vertices" caused flickering on multiple views.
2. Annoying mouse issues with the manipulator. 
3. The selection highlight feature in the text editor was sometimes not synchronised with the 3D view.
4. [CSG] Rotating a part at 90 degree: It got undesired 0.0 digits.


### 12 Jul 2016
With the release of **0.8.18** you are able to...
- ...trigger "Show selection in Text Editor" from a button on the GUI of the 3D editor.

- ...customize the colours of the selection cross (3D editor) 

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Wrong BFC rendering for primitives (in the primitve area)
2. TJunctionFinder eliminates lines at random (normal mode)
3. The "(!)" sign is set for (part) files which are created by the PartReview tool. This is not desired. (the "(!)" sign indicates that the file is located outside the project or the library structure of the project)


### 6 Jul 2016
With the release of **0.8.17** you are able to...
-  ...set the maximum amount of custom colours.

-  ...reset the colour palette.
-  ...see only the 3D editor on start / "new.dat" is virtual and not a critical "unsaved" file.
-  ...benefit from more parser magic: a BFC INVERTNEXT placed before a flat primitive triggers a warning with a quick fix. 
-  ...benefit from more digits for the position/scale/rotate/translate entry fields.

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Problem with selection: selection menu shows checkboxes for line/triangle... etc. They should act as filters, but if you uncheck "lines", select a triangle, and use "select connected" the lines connected are selected, too.
2. Flipper: Condlines are "not recalculated" so their control points are wrong after flipping.
3. If you hide a primitive preceded by an INVERTNEXT, this INVERTNEXT remains active and inverts all elements until an other primitive is encountered.
4. Select the last line in text editor by clicking on line number, and if that last line has no CRLF behind, then the last two characters of the line are not selected.


### 29 Jun 2016
With the release of **0.8.16** you are able to...

The following critical issues are fixed:
1. Invalid parsing of 0 BFC INVERTNEXT (the parser implementation was wrong)
2. "Conditional Control Point Vertices" caused flickering on multiple views.
3. The behavior of automatically selecting as well the neighboring line when clicking in the line numbers bar was incorrect.
4. Flipping two triangles was only possible with a different triangle colour than colour 16.
5. While are able to select a surface by clicking on it, even if only a small portion is visible, you were able to select only lines/condlines if BOTH end vertices were visible.
6. Rounding issues (NullPointerException)
7. Helper function issues with vertices and their relationship to LDraw data (NullPointerException)
8. "Hide & Show" issues (NullPointerException)
9. Clipboard issues (NullPointerException)
10. Colour change issues (NullPointerException)
11. Cut and delete issues (NullPointerException)
12. The subfile compiler meta command (" 0 !LPE INLINE") created sometimes a new virtual part file, but it did not remove the old one!
13. There was a synchronisation bug regarding the 3D manipulator.
14. When you mirrored a selection, the winding of triangle/quads was correctly inverted. But primitives in selection were not BFC inverted!

3. Fixed a NullPointerException which occurred during the transformation of CSG bodies (3D editor only)
4. Fixed a NullPointerException which occurred during the colour change for CSG bodies (3D editor only)
5. The QuickFix for the part description transformed the first line into a comment.
6. Line-type 1 Syntax Highlighting: Wrong yellow underline for files which were found on the hard-disk. 


### 13 May 2016
The following critical issues are fixed:
1. The PartReview progress monitor did not update the status info.
2. "Split View Horizontally / Vertically" did not work correct with the new sync. feature (Zoom / Manipulator / Translation).
3. "Intersector" did not hide primitives.
4. The LDU to Inch factor was not correct (was 0.015625, but should be 0.015748).
5. Released translation / property files for the German language version too early.
6. MeshReducer did not always terminate automatically (but the manual "Cancel" button worked).
7. SWTException: Widget is Disposed, when inserted something.
8. Transform selection (Subfiles) threw a NullPointerException.
9. A colour change (Subfiles) threw a NullPointerException.
10. The OpenGL line width for primitives was not constant (Primitive Area).
11. After I used SymSplitter to get half of a file, and then used the Select ...All Shown, all edges, tris and quads in hidden primitives and subfiles were selected too.
12. "Drag & Drop" with primitives led to an event overflow, which slowed down the OpenGL render engine.
13. Open *.dat File (3D Editor) threw a NullPointerException.
14. The Subfiler didn't include and move comments. They're left behind in the main file. The structure of the file was lost.
