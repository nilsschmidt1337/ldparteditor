COLOUR_1        = No colour modifications.
COLOUR_2        = Converted triangles are colored in yellow, newly formed rect primitives are colored blue.
MAX_ANGLE       = Maximum angle formed by two triangles (default: 0.95\u00B0)
RECT_1          = Convert bordered rhombuses into rect primitives.
RECT_2          = Do not convert bordered rhombuses into rect primitives.
RECT_3          = Convert to rect primitives, if possible.
RECT_4          = Rectifier does not convert quad to rect when the quad has adjacent condline(s).\nThis may improve smooth shading of the part.
RECT_5          = Create warped rect primitives with shear or non-trivial rotation matrices.
RECT_6          = Do not create warped rect primitives with shear or non-trivial rotation matrices.
SCOPE_FILE      = Scope: File
SCOPE_SELECTION = Scope: Selection
TITLE           = Rectifier [Arbitrary Precision]
TRI_QUADS_1     = Transform triangles into quads.
TRI_QUADS_2     = Rectifier does not attempt to transform triangles into quads.
VERBOSE         = Verbose
VERBOSE_MSG     = {0} Triangle(s) paired into quads\n{1} Condline(s) deleted\n{2} Quad(s) converted to rect primitives\n{3} Edge line(s) converted to rect primitives
